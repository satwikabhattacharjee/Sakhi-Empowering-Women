DOMAIN: Social Issue

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

The cases of Domestic Abuse are rising substantially. Therefore, it is necessary to tackle these issues for facilitating the empowerment women. Domestic Abuse, if not taken care of at the right time, results in lot of agony for the victim: mentally as well as emotionally. 
Our solution to this issue aims to take action against such crimes and to give hopes and motivation to the victim. 

SOLUTION:

We are looking forward to a make an app "Sakhi" which will have 3 sections: "Consolation", "Take Action" and "Emergency". 

Under "Consolation", we would provide a chatbot to the victim of the abuse to console her and to avoid suicidal tendencies. The conversation will be focussed on the positives in her life, her loved ones and information/ contacts about the organisations that can help her to cope with the problem.

Under "Take Action", we will create a form to register a complaint against domestic abuse. The responses will be shared with the local Women Protection Cell. The form will have fields like husband's image for identification, proofs of harassment (image/ audio), marriage certificate, duration of suffering and details of any witness.

Under "Emergency", we would provide real-time help on just a click of the emergency button. After clicking the button, audio recording will start so that real-time recorded foul language can be used as a proof later on, a call or message will be sent to the friend as well as to the local Women Protection Cell notifying the address of the victim and the need of an immediate help.
